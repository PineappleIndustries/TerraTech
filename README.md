# TerraTech
A Minecraft modpack containing new world generation, biomes, mobs, items, and more! 

TerraTech: Genesis aims on building upon the exploration and adventure aspects of Minecraft, creating an immersive, enticing experience with:

 

100+ New, unique Biomes
150+ exciting, peaceful, and dangerous mobs
New blocks, gear, items, tools, and so much more!
 

We also hope to create a welcoming, accepting community in which you are able to share your experiences and enjoy your worlds with the knowledge that there are people able to help, make suggestions, and support you! The project was originally focused on world generation, so it contains mods like Terraforged and Biomes O' Plenty. It has expanded to contain new structures, mobs, and cave generation! As there is not much magic (which will be included in TerraTech 2), this modpack is focused on adding to vanilla Minecraft with little quests and RPG related features, with more focus on world generation and mobs. Enjoy!

 About Shaders:
 
 In the newer files I have been adding other additional files, which are for shaders! I have attempted to add features for performance to appeal to as wide a range of Minecraft players as possible, but if you have a decent PC or desire to try shaders or other Optifine features with this modpack, I hope this will work for you! If you do not know how to add Optifine to a modpack, this video does quite a good job of explaining how to, in my opinion. If you do not know why you are not able to install Optifine in Curseforge modpacks, it is to do with licensing issues. For more information, you are able to look on the Curseforge help page. I hope you enjoy this, and please ask any questions regarding this element of the modpack if you would like to!
